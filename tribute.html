        <h3>Early Life and Career</h3>
        <p>
            Hedy Lamarr was born in Vienna, Austria, and started her film career with "Ecstasy" in 1933. To escape her Nazi husband, she disguised herself as a maid and fled to the United States. In Hollywood, she signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and starred in the movie "Boom Town" with Clark Gable in 1940.

        <h3>Contributions to Technology</h3>
        <p>
            In 1942, Hedy Lamarr and George Antheil co-invented a technology called frequency hopping spread spectrum. This technology, originally created for secure communication during World War II, became the basis for modern wireless technologies like WiFi and Bluetooth.
